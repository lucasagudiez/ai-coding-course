## NEW COURSE CONCEPT TO APPLY

**Course:** Become a programmer in just 10 days

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **No code writing required** - Use AI tools to build software
2. **10-day intensive format** - Fast results
3. **Latest AI tools** - Cutting-edge approach

**Suggested Messaging Pivots:**
- From "No coding experience required" → "You'll never write a line of code"
- From "Learn Python/AI theory" → "Learn to command AI to code for you"
- From "Pre-college course" → Could target broader audience (career changers, entrepreneurs, etc.)
- From "Programming 90 min" → "Building with AI 90 min"

**Potential Headlines:**
- "Become a Programmer in 10 Days — Without Writing a Single Line of Code"
- "The Future of Programming is Here: Let AI Write Your Code"
- "Build Real Software Using Only AI Tools"
- "From Zero to Programmer — The AI-Powered Way"
