Application Processing Fee

Why We Charge an Application Fee
Most selective programs charge $50-$250 for application processing. 
We've set our fee at $1 to remain accessible while maintaining program quality.

This nominal fee covers:
• Two-stage review process (AI screening + committee evaluation)
• Personalized assessment of program fit
• Administrative and payment processing costs

Refund Policy
If your application is not accepted, your $1 fee is automatically refunded 
within 48 hours. No action required.

For context: Harvard Business School's MBA application fee is $250. 
Most coding bootcamps charge $100-$500. Our $1 fee maintains selective 
admissions while removing financial barriers to application.

3. **Comparison table** - Still shows alternatives, but factual and respectful
4. **Progress bar** - Still tracks completion, but without cheerleading
5. **$1 application fee** - Still required, but with full justification and industry context
6. **Qualification message** - Still provides personalized feedback, but measured and professional
7. **Timeline/process** - Still explains next steps, but formal and clear
