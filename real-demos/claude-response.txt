Dear Sarah,

Your background in teaching, particularly your focus on dyslexia, is truly inspiring. It's not every day we encounter someone with such a unique and valuable perspective. 

Rather than viewing your lack of coding experience as a hindrance, we see it as a strength. Your domain expertise, coupled with your vast experience in crafting over 500 lesson plans, prepares you uniquely for a career in ed-tech. Your intimate understanding of the needs of dyslexic students is something coding alone cannot achieve.

As for your concerns about age and competing with CS grads, remember, it's never too late to pursue your passions. Your real-world experience is a valuable asset that sets you apart. 

Companies like Khan Academy, Duolingo, and Quizlet would greatly benefit from your insights to improve their platforms for dyslexic students. They don't just need coders, they need educators who understand their users.

Your dream project of a reading app for dyslexic students aligns perfectly with our mission. We're excited to help you turn your invaluable experience into a tool that can change the lives of many students.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
