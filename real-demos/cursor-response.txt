Dear Sarah,

Your experience as a 5th grade teacher and intimate understanding of the challenges dyslexic students face uniquely position you for a career in ed-tech. Your ability to design accessible content, demonstrated through 500+ individualized lesson plans, is a highly sought-after skill in this field.

Your dream project, an adaptive reading app for dyslexic students, could substantially improve learning experiences for many. We suggest considering features like gamification for engagement, or partnering with speech therapists or neurologists for more insights. 

Age and background should never be barriers to following your passion. In fact, your unique perspective could provide fresh solutions in the tech space. Many successful tech entrepreneurs began their journeys later in life. With your educational background and commitment, you can not only compete with CS grads but also bring something unique to the table.

Remember, one's career path is a personal journey, not a race. We believe you can make a significant contribution to ed-tech, enhancing learning experiences for students with dyslexia. We encourage you to pursue this transition with confidence.

Best wishes,
[Your Name]
