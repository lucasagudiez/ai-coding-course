## 📊 A/B TEST PRIORITIES

Test these in order:
1. **Headline variations** (current vs "This is Your Last Chance to...")  
2. **CTA button text** ("Apply $1" vs "Reserve My Spot - $1" vs "Lock In My Transformation - $1")  
3. **Payment clarity wording** (current vs even more explicit)  
4. **Scarcity intensity** (7 spots vs 3 spots)  
5. **Form length** (current vs simplified 2-step)  

---

## 🚫 WHAT TO AVOID (Pitfalls)

1. ❌ Fake scarcity (must be real or you'll destroy trust)  
2. ❌ Too many CTAs (one primary action only)  
3. ❌ Overwhelming with too many bonuses (pick 3-5 best)  
4. ❌ Slow load times (kills mobile conversions)  
5. ❌ Hidden terms (transparency = trust)  
6. ❌ Generic testimonials ("Great program!" vs specific results)  
7. ❌ Asking for unnecessary fields (every field = 5-10% drop)  

---

## 💰 EXPECTED CONVERSION LIFT

Based on case studies:
- Exit-intent popup: +15-25% recovery  
- Video testimonials: +30-50% trust  
- Micro-celebrations: +20-30% completion  
- Sticky urgency bar: +10-15%  
- Guarantee stack: +25-40%  
- Mobile optimization: +50-80% (mobile users)  

**Combined effect: 2-3x conversion rate increase possible**

## 📝 NEXT STEPS
