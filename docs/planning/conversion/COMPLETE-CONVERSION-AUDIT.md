## ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (High Priority)

### From Original Plan:

1. **Progressive micro-commitments** (qualifying questions between sections)
   - "What makes you think you're a good fit?"
   - "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you?"
   - "When can you start?" (with urgency)

2. **Collapsible sections** (progressive disclosure)
   - Form sections expand as user completes them
   - Payment section only visible after all fields filled
   - Sunk cost amplification

3. **Exit-intent popup** (25% recovery potential)
   - Triggers when user tries to leave
   - Testimonial + refund reminder
   - One-click "Reserve Spot" CTA

4. **Sticky urgency header** (10-15% lift)
   - Floats at top when scrolling
   - Shows spots remaining + time left

5. **Micro-celebrations** (20-30% completion boost)
   - Positive reinforcement after each section
   - "🎉 Great! You're ahead of 80% who never start"

6. **Interactive pre-qualifier quiz** (self-assessment)
   - 3-4 quick yes/no questions
   - "Based on your answers, you're a PERFECT FIT"
   - Makes them commit before form

7. **Visual comparison table** (not just list)
   - Time to job, cost, success rate comparison
   - Adava vs bootcamp vs self-learning

8. **Opportunity cost calculator**
   - "Every day you wait = $266 in lost potential salary"
   - Real-time math based on average graduate salary

9. **"What Happens Next" visual timeline**
   - Day 1: Apply → Day 3: Decision → Day 10: Start
   - Reduces uncertainty

10. **Video testimonials** (30-50% trust lift)
    - 30-second clips from real students
    - NOT just text

11. **Guarantee stack** (multiple layers)
    - Visual list of ALL guarantees
    - Not scattered throughout

12. **Loss aversion framing**
    - "Don't be the person who looks back in 5 years..."
    - More than just FOMO

13. **Inline FAQ** (objection crushing)
    - Appears contextually
    - "What if I can't code?" → immediate answer

14. **Identity-based messaging**
    - "This is for people who are DONE making excuses"
    - Speaks to who they want to become

15. **Reciprocity trigger** (free value first)
    - "Download our AI Coding Cheat Sheet free"
    - Give before asking

16. **Authority markers** (visual)
    - Instructor badges: "Ex-Google", "Ex-Meta"
    - Media mentions: "Featured in..."

17. **Price justification breakdown**
    - ROI math: "$590 ÷ $94K salary = 0.6% cost"
    - Visual breakdown

18. **Shame/regret prevention**
    - "The only regret past students have? Not applying sooner"

19. **Auto-save + email reminder**
    - Save form progress
    - Email: "You're 80% done! Finish in 2 min"

20. **Founder video message**
    - 60-second personal message
    - Human connection

21. **Post-submit upsell/downsell**
    - "Skip the line? Pay $590 now + bonuses"
    - Or scholarship option

22. **Mobile-specific optimizations**
    - One field per screen
    - Larger touch targets
    - Autofill everything

    - Before form: "This application takes 8-12 minutes"

### From Noah Kagan (AppSumo):

47. **"No-Brainer" Offer Stacking**
    - $17,000 value for $590 is good
    - But add: "+ 5 bonuses worth $2,000" = $19K for $590
    - Make it IMPOSSIBLE to say no

48. **Deadline Funnel** (real deadlines)
    - Cohort start date = hard deadline
    - "Applications close 7 days before start"
    - Real scarcity, not fake

### From Pat Flynn (Smart Passive Income):
