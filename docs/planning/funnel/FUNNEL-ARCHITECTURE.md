# 3-Page Funnel Architecture

## **Flow:**

```
INDEX PAGE
↓ (Click "Apply Now")
↓
APPLICATION PAGE (SHORT & SIMPLE)
- Urgency bar (3 spots left)
- Basic info (name, email, phone)
- Background (status, coding exp, AI tools)
- Goals (primary goal, why now)
- Time commitment
- $10 payment
→ Submit
↓
EVALUATION PAGE (LOADING + PRE-SELECTION)
- Loading bar (10 seconds)
- "Analyzing your application..."
- Result: "You've been pre-selected as a top match!"
- CTA: "Reserve Your Spot Now"
→ Click
↓
RESERVATION PAGE (VALUE STACKING)
- All the conversion tactics HERE
- Comparison table
- Value stack ($17K → $590)
- Testimonials
- Bonus stack
- Social proof
- Guarantees
- $580 payment (total $590)
```

## **What Goes Where:**

### **APPLICATION** (Keep SHORT):
- ✅ Urgency bar (3 spots, countdown)
- ✅ Progress bar
- ✅ Basic form fields
- ✅ $10 payment
- ❌ NO value stacking
- ❌ NO comparison tables
- ❌ NO testimonials
- ❌ NO bonuses

### **EVALUATION** (NEW):
- ✅ Loading animation (10s)
- ✅ "Pre-selected" message
- ✅ Brief social proof
- ✅ CTA to reservation

### **RESERVATION** (ALL THE SELLING):
- ✅ Comparison table (component)
- ✅ Value stack (component)
- ✅ Testimonials (component)
- ✅ Outcomes (component)
- ✅ Stats banner (component)
- ✅ Bonus stack (component)
- ✅ Pain points (component)
- ✅ $580 payment ($590 total - $10 already paid)

## **Benefits:**

1. **Shorter application** = Higher completion rate
2. **Evaluation page** = Commitment & consistency (they already paid $10)
3. **Reservation page** = All selling happens AFTER they're pre-selected
4. **Sunk cost** = They paid $10, went through evaluation, now invested

This is a CLASSIC high-conversion funnel structure! 🚀
