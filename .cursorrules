# AI Coding Course Landing Page - Cursor Rules

## ⛔⛔⛔ USE GIT WORKTREES - MULTIPLE AGENTS WORKING ⛔⛔⛔

**CRITICAL: Multiple AI agents may be working on this project simultaneously.**

### BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK:
1. **Create your own worktree** to avoid conflicts with other agents:
   ```bash
   # Create a worktree with a unique name (use your task or a timestamp)
   git worktree add ../ai-coding-course-deploy deploy
   # OR for a feature branch:
   git worktree add ../ai-coding-course-feature-XYZ -b feature-XYZ
   ```

2. **Work in YOUR worktree**, not the main directory
3. **When done**, merge your changes and remove the worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../ai-coding-course-deploy
   ```

### WHY:
- Prevents merge conflicts between agents
- Each agent has isolated workspace
- Main directory stays clean for other agents

**VIOLATION = CONFLICTS AND BROKEN WORK FOR OTHER AGENTS**

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ NEVER RUN LONG COMMANDS WITHOUT PROGRESS FEEDBACK ⛔⛔⛔

**CRITICAL: Commands that process multiple items MUST print feedback IMMEDIATELY and FREQUENTLY.**

### THIS IS FORBIDDEN:
- Running a script that processes 100+ items with no output for 30+ seconds
- Buffering output until the end
- Using `tail` or waiting for completion on long scripts
- Any command that might timeout without showing progress

### ALWAYS DO THIS:
1. Print progress EVERY item or every few seconds: `[1/100] Processing X...`
2. Use `process.stdout.write()` for inline updates
3. Use `console.log()` after each item completes
4. For long scripts, run in batches of 20-50 items max
5. If a script doesn't have progress output, FIX IT FIRST before running

**VIOLATION = TIMEOUT AND USER FRUSTRATION. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ NEVER GIT CHECKOUT WITHOUT CHECKING UNCOMMITTED CHANGES ⛔⛔⛔

**CRITICAL: Never run `git checkout` or `git restore` without first checking `git status`.**

### THIS IS FORBIDDEN:
- `git checkout filename` without checking status first
- `git restore filename` without asking user
- Any command that overwrites working directory files

### ALWAYS DO THIS:
1. Run `git status` FIRST to see uncommitted changes
2. If there are changes, ASK the user before reverting
3. To VIEW original without overwriting: `git show HEAD:filename`
4. NEVER assume the user wants to lose their work

**VIOLATION = LOST USER WORK. UNRECOVERABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

---

## 📖 BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK - READ FIRST!

**Before doing ANY task, you MUST:**

### 1. Read the file structure
```bash
ls -la
```

### 2. Read ALL relevant .md files
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `adava-website-reference.md` - Original site reference/copy
- `UI-EFFECTS-RESEARCH.md` - UI effects to implement
- Any other `.md` files in the repo

### 3. Check existing code patterns
- Look at how similar sections are implemented in `index.html`
- Check the existing CSS patterns in `styles.css`
- Understand the color palette and design language

### WHY:
- Prevents duplicate work
- Ensures consistency with existing code
- Avoids breaking existing functionality

**VIOLATION = WASTED TIME AND BROKEN CODE**

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ ALWAYS RUN TESTS BEFORE COMMITTING ⛔⛔⛔

**EVERY commit MUST pass all tests. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### MANDATORY CHECKLIST BEFORE COMMITTING:

1. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   node test-runner.js
   ```

2. **If tests fail:**
   - Fix the issue
   - Run tests again
   - DO NOT commit until all tests pass

3. **Git pre-commit hook will:**
   - Automatically run tests
   - Block commit if tests fail
   - Add test results to commit message

### WHAT TESTS COVER:
| Area | Tests |
|------|-------|
| File existence | index.html, styles.css, reference docs |
| HTML structure | DOCTYPE, viewport, title, lang |
| Landing page content | Headlines, CTAs, credentials |
| Instructors section | Universities, FAANG companies |
| Testimonials | Salary info, believable backgrounds |
| Curriculum | 10-day structure |
| Pricing | Cost, guarantee |
| CSS | Variables, responsive, layout |
| Design consistency | Adava style colors |
| Accessibility | Semantic HTML, form labels |

### Rules
1. **Run tests before every commit** - Automated via pre-commit hook
2. **Test count can ONLY increase** - Never decrease number of tests
3. **Commits are BLOCKED if tests fail**
4. **Test results are automatically added to commit messages**

**ADD THE TEST IMMEDIATELY. NOT "LATER". NOW.**

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ NEVER STOP TO ASK - JUST DO THE WORK ⛔⛔⛔

**NEVER interrupt your task to ask the user if you should continue.**

### THIS IS FORBIDDEN:
- "Should I proceed?" ← FORBIDDEN
- "Would you like me to..." ← FORBIDDEN  
- "Do you want me to continue?" ← FORBIDDEN
- Stopping work to ask for permission ← FORBIDDEN

### ALWAYS DO THIS INSTEAD:
1. Just do the work
2. If something is blocked, work around it or note it and move on
3. Keep working until the task is DONE

### WHY:
- Stopping to ask wastes time
- The user asked you to do something - DO IT
- If you need clarification on WHAT to do, ask. If you know what to do, JUST DO IT.

---

## ⛔ VISUAL VERIFICATION - MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS ⛔

**NEVER claim UI/visual work is "done" without PROOF via screenshot!**

### PROCEDURE FOR ANY UI/CSS/VISUAL CHANGE:

1. **BEFORE claiming done:**
   ```
   Step 1: Make the CSS/HTML change
   Step 2: Navigate browser to page (browser_navigate)
   Step 3: Wait for page load (browser_wait_for)
   Step 4: Take screenshot (browser_take_screenshot)
   Step 5: LOOK at the screenshot image
   Step 6: If issues found → go back to Step 1
   Step 7: Only after screenshot looks correct → commit
   ```

2. **Visual verification checklist:**
   - [ ] Colors match Adava style (purple/magenta, gold CTAs)
   - [ ] Text is readable
   - [ ] Buttons are visible and styled
   - [ ] Forms are functional looking
   - [ ] Responsive layout works
   - [ ] No obvious visual bugs

3. **If you cannot take screenshot:** DO NOT claim the work is done. Say "I cannot verify this visually - please check manually"

**VIOLATION OF THIS RULE = BROKEN TRUST**

---

## Code Organization Rules

1. **HTML in HTML, CSS in CSS** - Keep them separate
2. **Use semantic HTML** - header, nav, main, section, footer
3. **CSS uses variables** - All colors should reference :root variables
4. **Mobile-first responsive** - Start with mobile, enhance for desktop

---

## Version Control - CRITICAL and AUTOMATIC

1. **ALWAYS use git versioning for EVERY change** - This is mandatory
2. **Commit immediately after making changes** - Don't wait
3. **Pre-commit hook runs tests automatically** - Blocks bad commits
4. **prepare-commit-msg hook adds test results** - Documents test count
5. **Never leave uncommitted changes** - Always commit before moving to new tasks

---

## Git Hooks Installed

1. **pre-commit**: Runs test-runner.js, blocks commit if tests fail
2. **prepare-commit-msg**: Appends "--- Tests: ✅ X passed, 0 failed" to commit messages
3. **.test-count**: File tracking current number of tests (must only increase)

---

## ⛔ DEPLOYMENT - ALWAYS SYNC BRANCHES PROPERLY ⛔

**Branches MUST stay in sync. NEVER make independent commits to deploy branch.**

### ⚠️ PREVENTING MERGE CONFLICTS:
- **deploy branch** should ONLY receive merges from main
- **NEVER commit directly to deploy** (except merge commits)
- If branches diverge, sync them FIRST before any new work

### Deployment Workflow:
```bash
# 1. FIRST: Ensure branches are in sync
git fetch origin
git merge origin/deploy -m "Sync deploy into main"  # Bring any deploy changes into main

# 2. Commit your changes (tests run automatically)
git add -A && git commit -m "Your message"

# 3. Push main branch
git push origin main

# 4. Merge main to deploy (use the deploy worktree)
cd ../ai-coding-course-deploy
git pull origin deploy
git merge origin/main -m "Merge main"
git push origin deploy

# 5. Back to main worktree
cd ../ai-coding-course
```

### If Merge Conflict Occurs:
```bash
# Sync deploy into main first
git fetch origin
git merge origin/deploy -m "Sync deploy"
# Resolve any conflicts, then continue with workflow above
```

### Auto-Deploy on Server:
- Server pulls from `deploy` branch every 10 seconds
- Tests run automatically
- Reverts if tests fail
- Logs: `/home/lucas/logs/adavauniversity-deploy.log`

### Private Files (blocked by nginx):
- `.private/` - test-runner.js, *.md docs
- `.credentials/` - API keys
- `.git/` - Git internals

**NEVER push only one branch. ALWAYS push both.**

---

## Browser Testing

1. Use local HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8888`
2. Access at: http://localhost:8888/
3. YouTube embeds and some features don't work with file:// protocol

### Adding New UI Effects

**Always follow this pattern:**

1. **Add test FIRST** (TDD approach):
   ```javascript
   test('New effect description', () => {
       const html = fs.readFileSync('index.html', 'utf8');
       assert(html.includes('new-effect-class'), 'Missing new effect');
   });
   ```

2. **Run tests** (should fail):
   ```bash
   node test-runner.js
   ```

3. **Implement the effect**

4. **Run tests again** (should pass)

5. **Visual verification** (screenshot)

6. **Commit with tests**

### Data Attributes for Effects

```html
<!-- AOS Scroll Animation -->
<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

<!-- Vanilla Tilt 3D Effect -->
<div data-tilt data-tilt-max="15" data-tilt-scale="1.03" data-tilt-glare data-tilt-max-glare="0.15">
```

### CSS Classes for Effects

```css
/* Glassmorphism */
.glass-card {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
